# diveApp
###A simple webpage with a form for posting messages about favorite diving \n
or snorkeling experiences.

The diveApp uses node.js, express.js, and ejs templating.
Messages are stored in JSON form in an online Firebase database.

####To start the app:

1. From the command line, type  `$ npm start`
2. From browser, visit   `127.0.0.1:3000`
3. Type a message... watch it updated.
4. Make it funny... we need something to spice up this fairly simple app.
